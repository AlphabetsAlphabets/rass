# srsa
A simple backend for creating and using RSA key pairs using the [rsa](https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA) crate.

This is meant to be plug and play and I plan to plug this in as a backend for other ideas I have in mind. This is also my **first time** doing anything crytography related and as such the choices I make may not be the best. Feel free to submit a PR or issue for any ideas or improvements you have.
